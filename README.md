# pdsutils
 PDS Utilities is a Java application that's intended to make handling and parsing [Planetary Data System](https://pds.nasa.gov/) data files generated by the [2003-2004 Mars Exploration Rovers Mission](https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/) an easier task.

It was originally released on August 15, 2004, and has been untouched and unmaintained since then. It is presented here for historical purposes, and released under its original BSD license, with the [3-clause BSD license](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause) addition.

This software is neither endorsed nor supported by NASA, JPL, its research affiliates, or the United States Government. 

The original PDS Utilities site is no longer online, but is available in the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20160511092408/http://hobbiton.thisside.net/pdsutils/) , and provides usage guidance and example input / output from the software. The as-released README file is also included in this repository.
