Thank you for downloading the PDS Utilities software!

Background
----------

Excerpted from http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov:

"The PDS archives and distributes scientific data from NASA planetary missions, 
astronomical observations, and laboratory measurements. The PDS is sponsored by 
NASA's Office of Space Science. Its purpose is to ensure the long-term usability 
of NASA data and to stimulate advanced research."


About the PDS Utilties
----------------------

This sofware is intended to make handling and parsing PDS data files generated by
the 2003-2004 Mars Exploration Rovers Mission (http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov) an
easier task. PDS data files have long filenames such as 1P136346286ETH1600P2550L7M1.IMG
, which provide a great deal of coded information about the data contained within the file.

The PDS Utilities simplify the task of understanding this metadata, by providing tools
for translating the values within the filename into useful, human readable information.


How to use the software
-----------------------

The PDS Utilities software is coded in the Java language, and provides an API for 
parsing PDS filenames, as well as a command-line utility that, when given a PDS filename,
will interpret the filename, and print out a text summary of the information within
the filename.

Javadocs for the API are located within the doc/ directory.

To use the command line utility under UNIX-type systems, run the getinfo.sh shell script
in the following way, where $pdsfilename is substituted for the name of the PDS file 
to interpret (see "About the PDS Utilities" above, for an example.

./getinfo.sh $pdsfilename


To use the command line utility under DOS-type systems, a batch file, getinfo.bat, is
provided. To run the utility, type the following command, substituting %pdsfile% for
the name of the PDS file to analyze.

getinfo %pdsfilename%


NOTE: For both DOS and UNIX-type systems, you must have the path to the java executable in
your PATH. If you don't have the Java JRE, it can be downloaded from http://java.sun.com/
